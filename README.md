## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo
This repository serves as a public, NDA-safe version of the type of work I do in real projects, helping recruiters and teams understand my skills clearly.

## Content Automation Mock Project
This is a mock, NDA-safe project designed to demonstrate my skills in:
- UX Design (personas, flows, wireframes)
- Product Requirement Writing (PRD)
- Business Analysis (user stories, acceptance criteria)
- Workflow Automation (n8n / API thinking)
- UAT Testing (positive/negative cases, regression scenarios)

⚠️ All content here is rewritten and sanitized. No confidential information from past employers is included.

## 🔥 What This Project Shows
- How I define a problem and convert it into clear product requirements
- How I design user flows and structure features
- How I write professional user stories + acceptance criteria
- How I conduct UAT and identify edge cases
- How I think about workflow automation (e.g., n8n)
